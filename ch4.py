# * VARIABLES *
# 4.1 - Variables and Values

# A variable lets you store a value, whether a string or interger, to a label.
x = 5
print(x)
# Giving x the value of 5 is called an assignment.

# Exercise: Assign how many seconds in a week to a variable and call it.
# Wow, almost like I did this already... ðŸ¤”
d = 7
s = 86400
print( d*s )

# When assigning a variable it is possible to overwrite it in the future with another function. When a variable is overwritten it will hold the last known value that it was given.

x = 5
print(x)
x = 7*9*13 # overwrite previous value of X
print(x)
x = "A nod\'s as good as a wink to a blind bat."
print(x)

# Once a variable has a value it can be used where you'd otherwise use values.
x = 2
y = 3
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
print("x*y =", x*y)
print("x+y =", x+y)

# You can copy the contents of one var to another using assignment operator.
x = 2
y = 3
print("x =", x, "and y =", y)

z = x
print(x)
x = x+3
print(x)

# A variable MUST be created before used. Running this will result in an error:
print(days_in_a_year)
days_in_a_year=365
# NameError: name 'days_in_a_year' is not defined

# 4.2 - Variable Names
# !! A variable name must consist of only:
# - Letters (Upper or lower, IS CASE SENSITIVE)
# - Digits
# - _ (Underscores)
# !! A variable name should not be a reserved word (keywords), which are:
# - False, None, True, and, as, assert, break
# - class, continuem, def, del, elif, else, except
# - finally, for, from, global, if, import, in
# - is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise
# - return, try, while, with, yield

a = 3.14159265
b = 7.5
c = 8.25
d = a*b*c / 3
print(d)

# This code calculates the volume of the cone and exhibits the importance of naming variables.
# If you were asked to change a portion of the volume of the cone, which one would you know to change?

pi = 3.14159265
radius = 7.5
height = 8.25
volume = pi*radius*height / 3
print(volume)

# This is much easier to interpret and explicitately states which variable is which. This is helpful to the programmer as well as others who would be reading the code.

# 4.2.2 - Practicing with variable names
# Exercise: Determine which of these variable names are legal or illegal.
classification = 1 # legal
Classification = 1 # legal
# cl@ssification = 1 # illegal, contains a symbol
classif1cat10n = 1 # legal
# 1classification = 1 # illegal, starts with a digit
_classification = 1 # legal
# class = 1 # illegal, reserved keyword
Class = 1 # legal, but not good as it uses a keyword as a name
